    "For our project, we want to look at multiple different qualities in anime and see if we can use that to predict the score of an anime on MyAnimeList. From our research, we know that MyAnimeList has the biggest data on anime with having the least amount of missing data. The same source mentions that there were no strict web scraping policies as of early 2024, but further research suggests the scraping the website wouldn't be allowed, yet we would be allowed to get data from their API that has similar data if we wanted. We also know a lot about how MyAnimeList calculates its weighted average anime scores from the previous projects. <a name=\"ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#ref-2) On top of that, we also found out that using a non-linear regression model would be more accurate than a linear one since their scores are also calculated on a non-linear formula.<a name=\"ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#ref-1)\n",

They first scraped the data from that website, created a collinearity heat map to remove highly collinear features. They then used multiple linear regression models and finalized with using the one that had the least amount of error (Polynomial). They found that anime based off manga, added as Favorite on MAL, and produced by Production I.G. showed a correlation with popular anime rating scores. Though, they also specified that MAL specifies that their anime scores are calculated on a non-linear formula while this prediction model was more linear. \n",

    "\nWe got our data from Kaggle, which ranks the animes off of MyAnimeList.com. There is privacy between the data because we are going through the anonymous opinions of viewers on show popularity. However, there is potential bias because the genres of anime can depend on the viewer.\n",
    "For instance, if the most common shows are shonen, then there could be higher-rated animes on MyAnimeList that belong to different genres, hence underrepresenting other types of anime.\n",
    "One way to detect these biases throughout the project is by making sure the data we collect isn’t invasive to any personal information of anybody.\n",
    "One problem that can affect our data analysis is that the ratings might be skewed towards popular genres, which impacts the fairness of rankings. To handle this issue, we can analyze the distribution of genres in the dataset to check for any disproportion."
